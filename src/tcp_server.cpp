/*
    RTOS Task for TCP Socket Listening
    Plan:
    - Create a TCP socket that actively listens on a port.
    Suggestions:
    - Port Number: Debug-related services often use ports in the 49152-65535 range (dynamic/private ports)
    - Open a TCP socket on the chosen port.
    - Bind it to the Pico Wâ€™s IP address.
    - Listen for incoming connections.
