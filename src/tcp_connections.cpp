/*
    Callback Function for Connection Requests
    Plan:
    - Handle the connection request.
    Suggestions:
    - Accept the connection, log the clientâ€™s IP/port.
    - Limiting the number of active connections to 1 for simplicity.
    Include connection cleanup:
    - Add logic to handle disconnections or timeouts gracefully.
